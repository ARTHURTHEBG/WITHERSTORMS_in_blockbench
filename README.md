# **WITHERSTORMS in blockbench**
this project is based onconverting models from the game Minecraft:story mode into objs that can be imported in blockbench.
# **how could i do that?**
You need 3dsMax and a script for it.
how to download 3dsMax? here is a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfiJdIqQDM0
link to the creator of the script: https://www.youtube.com/@gamerwhogames2081 (he even made a tutorial on how to get the script and get the d3dmesh files in)
link to his dropbox (where is the script and some models for examples): https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nbyhk1u3taoh53p/AABr24EOlZJTW8RUsq4KRZrYa?dl=0
When you got evrything, you run the script in 3dsMax and import d3dmesh files, when the importing is done you export it as a obj.
# **But how could i do this without 3dsMax?**
well you can use the d3dmesh converter by *telltale modding group* https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/D3DMESH-Converter
